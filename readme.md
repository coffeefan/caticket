# Covid Event Ticketing System 
This is a very simple event ticketing system for reserving your seat at a event. Because of Corona free 
events like church services have limited seats and visitors have to register before.

## Basic Setup
- Clone it
- Under the folder api install all composer packages
```
composer install
```
- Create database with database.sql 
- Create /api/config.php based on config.md
- Install Cronjob for /api/clearing

## Give me feedback :)
It is my first vuejs project
